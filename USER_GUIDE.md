## 🛠️ What Gas Genie Can Do (The 8 Tools)

Gas Genie is equipped with 8 specialized tools that connect directly to your database, Google Calendar, and Gmail. Here is a breakdown of what you can ask it to do, along with example prompts.

### 3. Diagnose Boiler Error Codes
Gas Genie has a built-in database of 29 common error codes across 8 major manufacturers (Vaillant, Worcester Bosch, Baxi, Ideal, Potterton, Glow-worm, Viessmann, Ferroli). It tells you the likely cause severity, and fix steps.
> **Try saying:**

## 💡 Tips for Best Results
- **Be Specific:** Provide as much detail as possible in a single sentence (e.g., provide both the make and error code when asking for a diagnosis).
- **Correct Mistakes:** If Gas Genie mishears a name or an address, just tell it to correct it before confirming the action.
- **Combined Actions:** You can seamlessly move from one task to another. For example, ask for an error code diagnosis, then ask to log a new job with that specific issue, and finally book an appointment — all in one conversation.
